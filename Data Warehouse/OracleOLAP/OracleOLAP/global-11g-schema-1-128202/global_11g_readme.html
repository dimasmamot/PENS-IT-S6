<H1><STRONG>Global Sample Schema for Oracle&reg; OLAP 11<I>g</I></STRONG></H1>

<P>The Global sample schema is used by the examples in the following
  OLAP documentation for Oracle OLAP 11<I>g</I> Release 1 (11.1)
  and Oracle OLAP 11<I>g</I> Release 2 (11.2).
<UL>
        <LI><I>Oracle OLAP User's Guide</I></LI>
  <LI><I>Oracle OLAP Java API Developer's Guide</I></LI>
  <LI><I>Oracle OLAP Java API Reference</I></LI>
</UL>
      These documents are in the Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) section of the
      Oracle Database Documentation Library.
      <UL>
        <LI>For the 11<I>g</I> Release 1 (11.1) documentation, see <a href=
      "http://www.oracle.com/pls/db111/portal.portal_db?selected=6&frame=#online_analytical_processing_(olap)"> OLAP Documentation for 11.1</a>.</LI>
        <LI>For the 11<I>g</I> Release 2 (11.2) documentation, see <a href=
	        "http://www.oracle.com/pls/db112/portal.portal_db?selected=6&frame=#online_analytical_processing_(olap)"> OLAP Documentation for 11.2</a>.</LI>
      </UL>
      <P> The Global schema contains eight tables. Examples in
        the Oracle OLAP documentation create OLAP dimensions, attributes, cubes,
        and measures and map them to columns in the relational tables.
      <P>For information on using Analytic Workspace Manager to define an OLAP
        dimensional data model and create an analytic workspace, see <I>Oracle
          OLAP User's Guide</I>. For information on defining an OLAP dimensional
        data model and creating analytic workspaces using the OLAP Java API, see <I>Oracle OLAP Java API Developer's Guide</I>.
      <H2>Prerequisites</H2>
      For access to the OLAP option, you need the Enterprise Edition of the
      Oracle Database 11<I>g</I> release that you are using.
      <P>For the <I>Oracle OLAP User's Guide</I> documents, you also need
        Analytic Workspace Manager 11<I>g</I> for the release that you are using.
      <P>To develop programs using the OLAP Java API, you also need a JDK or
        IDE, such as JDeveloper, that is  compatible  with the release that you are using.
        For those prerequisites, see the <I>Oracle OLAP Java API Developer's Guide</I> or <I>Oracle OLAP
          Java API Reference</I> documents.
      <H2>Sample Kit Contents</H2>
      The sample kit is in the compressed file <CODE>global_11g_schema.zip</CODE>. The sample kit includes:
      <UL>
        <LI>A script that installs the Global schema, <CODE>global_11g_install.sql</CODE>. This script does the following:
          <UL>
              <LI>Prompts for a password for the GLOBAL user.
              <LI>Creates the GLOBAL user and grants to GLOBAL the privileges
                required to create and use analytic workspaces.
              <LI>Connects as the GLOBAL user.
              <LI>Imports the tables and data of the schema. </LI>
          </UL>
        <LI>A script that creates the GLOBAL analytic workspace in the GLOBAL
          schema, <CODE>global_11g_create_cubes.sql</CODE>. This script does the
          following:
          <UL>
              <LI>Prompts for the file system directory where the installation files
                are found. This file system directory is used in the definition of an
                Oracle directory object.
              <LI>Prompts for a GLOBAL user password
              <LI>Connects as the GLOBAL user
              <LI>Drops the GLOBAL analytic workspace if it already exists
              <LI>Creates the GLOBAL analytic workspace, including all the cubes and
                dimensions. Views and materialized views are created over the cubes
                and dimensions. </LI>
          </UL>
        <LI>The <CODE>global_11g_source.dmp</CODE> file, which contains the
          GLOBAL tables and relational metadata that are required to enable
          general query refresh and rewrite for cube materialized views. This
          includes primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and
          relational dimension objects. For more details on the required metadata,
          please refer to <I>Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide</I>, which is
          available in the Supporting Documentation section of the Oracle Database
          Documentation Library. For 11<I>g</I> Release 1, see <a href=

      <H2>Tables in the Global Schema</H2>
      The Global schema has four dimension
      tables, two fact tables, and two other tables. The following table lists
      the tables and provides brief descriptions of them.
